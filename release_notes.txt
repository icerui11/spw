Notes Author	: 	James E Logan (4Links ltd)

Version Notes:

This is the initial public release of 4Links Opensouce SpaceWire IP Cores. This release includes the following:

-- 	SpaceWire CoDec:
	SpaceWire Transciever for establishing and maintaining the low-level SpaceWire connection. Supports the sending of Data, Timecodes and Error codes
	over the spacewire link. This IP is used by all 4Links RMAP IP to implement the SpaceWire link. 
	
--	RMAP Target: 
	Implements an RMAP Target for memory mapped applications over SpaceWire. 
	Implements RMAP CRC checking and creation for Rx/Tx communication.

-- 	RMAP Initiator: 
	Implements an RMAP Initiator for construction of RMAP Frames to be transmitted over a SpaceWire link. 
	Has Parallel/Serial interface options. Performs CRC creation and checking for Tx/Rx communication.
	Seperate RMAP Header & Data Interfaces for ease of implementation. 

-- 	RMAP Peripheral UART Target & Initiator:
	Basic UART to RMAP/SpaceWire Bridge IP for RMAP Target and RMAP Initiator. 
	Initiator takes UART data with a shortened RMAP protocol and transmits via spaceiwre. 
	Target Takes RMAP over Spacewire and transmits over UART. Examples should be modified to implement features as required. 

-- 	RMAP Router:
	A SpaceWire/RMAP Router IP. Configurable upto 32 Ports (1 Virtual, 31 Physical). Implements a non-blocking X-Bar switch 
	and multiple port arbitration methods. Implementation tested on a Xilinx XKCU040 with SpaceWire line-rates >400MHz for both 13
	and 32* port designs. Virtual port (0) implements an RMAP Target for reading/writing the router configuration space and routing table. 
	XBar switch fabric bus-width configurable from 9bit to 36-bit transactions, Gray-FiFo used for clock-domain crossing between
	SpaceWire Port and Router Logic clock domain(s). 
	

TCL scripts for building projects (Vivado) in /tcl directory. Instructions for manually importing IP into your project are
included in the respective IP documentation scr/4Links/IP_NAME/Docs
